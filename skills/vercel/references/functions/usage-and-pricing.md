# Usage and Pricing (Fluid Compute)

Vercel Functions on fluid compute are priced on three dimensions: Active CPU, Provisioned Memory, and Invocations. Active CPU pauses billing during I/O; Provisioned Memory bills continuously while an instance handles requests.

## Plan Inclusions

| Resource | Hobby | Pro |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Active CPU | 4 hours/month | Pay per use |
| Provisioned Memory | 360 GB-hrs/month | Pay per use |
| Invocations | 1 million/month | 1 million/month |

Enterprise: custom terms.

## Billing Concepts

| Metric | What is billed | Pauses during I/O? |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Active CPU | Actual code execution time (CPU-hours) | Yes |
| Provisioned Memory | Memory allocated × instance lifetime (GB-hours) | No |
| Invocations | Each incoming request | N/A |

### Example Calculation

Function: 4 GB memory, São Paulo (`gru1`), rates $0.221/hr CPU, $0.0183/GB-hr memory.
One request: 4s active CPU, 10s instance lifetime:

- CPU cost: (4s / 3600) × $0.221 = $0.000246
- Memory cost: (4 GB × 10s / 3600) × $0.0183 = $0.000203
- Total: ~$0.000449 per invocation

## Notes

- I/O wait (AI model calls, database queries) does not count toward Active CPU time
- Provisioned Memory billing continues even during I/O, as the instance is kept alive
- Memory billing stops after the last in-flight request completes; no charge during idle
- Setting a reasonable `maxDuration` prevents runaway cost
- I/O-bound workloads (API calls, DB queries) are cost-effective because Active CPU pauses during waits
- CPU-intensive workloads (image processing, ML inference) cost more in Active CPU

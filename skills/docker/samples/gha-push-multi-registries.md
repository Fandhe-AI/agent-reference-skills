# Push to multiple registries with GitHub Actions

Log in to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry and push one build to both.

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  push:

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v4
        with:
          username: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v4
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v4

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v7
        with:
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          push: true
          tags: |
            user/app:latest
            user/app:1.0.0
            ghcr.io/user/app:latest
            ghcr.io/user/app:1.0.0
```

## Notes

- GitHub Actions workflow syntax and `secrets` / `vars` contexts are covered by the github-docs skill.
- Each registry needs its own `docker/login-action` step; the `tags` list can mix both registries' names.
